# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM

# ðŸ“ŒProject Overview: 
##  Description: 
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a high-speed, synchronous serial 
communication protocol commonly used for short-distance data exchange, 
particularly in embedded systems. It enables efficient and simultaneous two-way (full 
duplex) communication between a master device and one or more slave devices. 
Thanks to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance, SPI is widely adopted for 
connecting microcontrollers with peripherals such as sensors, memory devices, and 
display modules.
